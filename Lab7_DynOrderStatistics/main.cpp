 *
 * Task:
 * You are required to implement correctly and efficiently the management operations of an order
 * statistics tree: build tree, select and delete.
 *
 * Solution:
 * -- Build Tree
 * The constructor of the tree takes as an argument a number n, and build a perfectly balanced
 * tree containing n nodes with keys 1..n in a preorder way:
 * - for each subtree containing nodes l..r, the middle element m of the [l..r] interval is taken
 * as root, so the size difference between the remaining left interval [l..m-1] and right
 * interval [m+1..r] is
 *   --> 1, if the length of interval [l..r] is even
 *   --> 0, if the length of the interval [l..r] is dd
 * - the left subtree is constructed containing the nodes with keys in [l..m-1]
 * - the right subtree is constructed cntaining the nodes with keys in [m+1..r]
 * Similarly to the preorder traversal, because the extra computations take constant time per
 * node, this build tree operation is O(n).
 *
 * -- Select
 * Given that the OSTree is an augmented BST, in order to find the ith smallest element in the
 * tree we can rely on the following observation: all the elements of the left subtree of a node
 * are smaller than the data of the node, whch is in turn smaller than the data of all nodes in
 * the right subtree. Thus:
 * - if i is smaller than or equal to the size of the left subtree, then the ith smallest element
 * should be in the left subtree
 * - if i is equal to the size of the left subtree + 1, then the ith smallest element is held by
 * the root
 * - if i is larger than the size of the left subtree + 1, then the ith smallest element is in
 * the right subtree, and there it is the element with index i-size(left subtree)-1
 * Based on these rules, the selecion path can't be longer than the longest path from the root to
 * a leaf, which is the height of the tree. Given that originally we build a PBT with height lgn,
 * and deletion doesn't increase the height, the complexity of this operation o o(lgn).
 *
 * -- Delete
 * The delete operation in an OS Tree works similarly to the delete in BST, with one extra
 * instruction per node: for each node along the path of deletion, the size of the subtree rooted
 * at that node has to be decreased by 1. This is important to guarantee that the size fields
 * remaing consistent after deletion.
 * Given that deletion in a BST is O(h), and here we originally build a PBT with h=lgn, and the
 * height can never be increased through deletion and selection, the complexity of this operation
 * is O(lgn).
